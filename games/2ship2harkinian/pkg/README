To run 2ship2harkinian you have to provide game assets, a ROM in z64 format.

There are some links that could help in this regard.

2ship2harkinian opens a dialog to let you choose the ROM in z64 format.
Depending on your desktop environment, install one of the dialog helper:

doas pkg_add zenity # dialogs for GNOME
doas pkg_add kdialog # KDE dialog boxes from shell scripts
