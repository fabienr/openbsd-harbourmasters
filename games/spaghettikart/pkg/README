NOTE, this is a wip ports, the game crash as soon as you enter a race.

To run SpaghettiKart you have to provide game assets, a ROM in z64 format.

There are some links that could help in this regard.
https://github.com/HarbourMasters/SpaghettiKart
https://github.com/sanni/cartreader

SpaghettiKart opens a dialog to let you choose the ROM in z64 format.
Depending on your desktop environment, install one of the dialog helper:

doas pkg_add zenity # dialogs for GNOME
doas pkg_add kdialog # KDE dialog boxes from shell scripts

Otherwise, run the following command with your ROM, replace baserom.z64
 with the actual ROM path on your system.

${LOCALBASE}/share/spaghettikart/torch o2r \
	-s ${LOCALBASE}/share/spaghettikart -d ~/.local/share/spaghettify \
	-a ${LOCALBASE}/share/spaghettikart/meta/mods.toml \
	baserom.z64
